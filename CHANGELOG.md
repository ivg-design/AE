# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [2026-07-11]

### Changed
- `Elast-o-matic` `1.0.0` → `1.1.1`:
  - Rigs each selected layer independently — one controller per layer driving all of that layer's selected properties, instead of piling every property's controller onto the first selected layer (which also left the expressions on other layers pointing at a controller that wasn't there).
  - Selecting a subset of a property's keyframes (two or more) now overshoots only off those keys; unselected keyframes, and the motion after them, stay native. The selection is captured **before** the controller is added, since `addProperty` reshuffles the timeline selection (the `1.1.0` window approach read the selection too late and showed no bounce).
- Bumped workspace + `@jsx-workspace/ae-scripts` package versions to `1.1.1`.

## [2026-07-04]

### Added
- **New scripts (4):**
  - `Elast-o-matic` `1.0.0` — elastic overshoot / gravity bounce after a keyframe; hold Cmd/Ctrl at launch to switch variant.
  - `Reseterator` `1.0.0` — zero the transform origin of selected layers (layer anchor to `[0,0,0]`, nested shape groups re-centered).
  - `Opac-o-bot` `1.0.0` — parenting for Opacity via expression.
  - `Controllerizer` `1.0.0` — gather selected properties from any layers onto one Controller Null as expression controls.
- **IVGD Command Bar** (`packages/ae-scripts/toolbar/IVGD Command Bar.jsx`) — dockable, resizable ScriptUI panel with one icon button per bundled script; responsive reflow, bundled tooltips, `ivg-scripts/` auto-discovery, and live Cmd/Ctrl variant-icon swapping.
- **Website** (`site/`) — self-contained static catalog, per-script docs viewer, animated hero, and a **Build-a-bar** client-side ZIP generator (checked scripts + the Command Bar). Deployed as an independent Vercel project to https://forge.mograph.life/apps/ae.
- **Test harness** (`tools/ae-test-harness`) — vitest pipeline: ES3 static parse (acorn), malformed-`@include` scan, expression syntax, functional sandbox, and ScriptUI capture. All 32 distributed scripts pass.
- `site/tools/build-data.mjs` — parses script front matter into `scripts.json` / `meta.json`, applies curated taglines from `copy-overrides.json`, and copies icons/docs/scripts/toolbar/template project into `site/` for self-containment.
- Bundled `Sync-o-tron.aep` template project that auto-imports on launch.

### Changed
- Rewrote all 32 distributed-script docs with a fixed section order (What it does → Controls & options → Usage → Notes → Requirements & edge cases → How it works) and purpose-first taglines.
- Bumped audited scripts: `Sync-o-tron` `2.1.4`, `Rectangulator` `2.1.5`, `Centralizer` `2.1.0`, `Distributron` `1.1.2`.

### Fixed
- `Centralizer` — removed a malformed `@include` comment that raised a line-87 syntax error; added multiselect, parametric-shape (Rect/Ellipse/Star), and image/precomp support with a union bounding box.
- `Rectangulator` — inlined dependencies, seeded the controller from the original rectangle, guarded expression control lookups, and fixed a stale path-group reference and the anchor-point control.
- `Sync-o-tron` — fixed the property-type probe (no value read / expression probing), a folder-nested reactor lookup, a multi-property build stall (expression suspend/restore), 3D per-axis expression generation, and the palette not closing after apply.

### Removed
- Excluded `Onionizer`, `PathDuplitron`, and `Split-o-matic_9x16` from distribution (still present in `src/`, omitted from the bundle, Command Bar, and website).

## [Earlier Unreleased]

### Added
- Vendored Smallpath `AdobeColorPicker` v2.0 under `vendors/AdobeColorPicker` and embedded a sanitized local copy in `ChromaBlenderizer`.

### Changed
- Replaced `Limb-a-tron` with the imported `2.7.0` regular/noodle limb rig and updated its front matter, feature descriptions, and catalog documentation.
- Updated `ChromaBlenderizer` to `2.3.1` with a modeless palette, swatch-only color picking, clearer target-selection guidance, swatch/picker tooltips, white default swatches, and repeat-apply workflow.

### Fixed
- Fixed `ChromaBlenderizer` swatch picks so the selected picker color updates the config used by `Apply Colors`.

## [2.0.0] - 2025-08-13

### Added
- Comprehensive monorepo structure with `packages/` organization
- 3 new scripts recovered from dist folder:
  - **[Linearizer](packages/ae-scripts/src/animation/Linearizer.jsx)** - Property linking with driver-based interpolation
  - **[Distributron](packages/ae-scripts/src/paths/Distributron.jsx)** - Layer distribution along shape paths  
  - **[Trace-o-matic](packages/ae-scripts/src/paths/Trace-o-matic.jsx)** - Mask to shape conversion with keyframes
- Complete JSDoc documentation for all 31 scripts
- [GitHub project](https://github.com/users/ivg-design/projects/6) for script maintenance and development
- Individual tracking issues for each script ([#2](https://github.com/ivg-design/JSX/issues/2)-[#39](https://github.com/ivg-design/JSX/issues/39))

### Changed
- Reorganized all scripts into categorized folders (animation, composition, effects, keyframes, layers, paths, utilities)
- Renamed all scripts to follow consistent naming convention:
  - it_follows → PathMaster
  - Parametric_IK_Limb → Limb-a-tron
  - All scripts now use "-tron", "-ator", "-o-matic" suffixes
- Updated all UI window titles and undo groups to match new names
- Standardized all scripts to version 2.0.0
- Moved frame-navigator to packages/cep-extensions/

### Fixed
- Documentation inconsistencies in [SCRIPT_FUNCTIONALITY_CATALOG.md](docs/development/SCRIPT_FUNCTIONALITY_CATALOG.md)
- Missing script descriptions in [README.md](README.md)
- Incorrect script counts (now correctly shows 31 scripts)

### Removed
- Duplicate scripts (Guiderator_calc, DualParentator)
- Old dist folder with outdated versions
- Deprecated test folders and files
- Legacy bundler configurations

## [1.0.0] - 2024-12-15

### Initial Release
- 28 production-ready After Effects scripts
- Basic folder organization
- Initial documentation
